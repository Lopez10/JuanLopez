Gherkin is a Domain Specific Language (DSL) used to write acceptance tests and behavioral specifications for software. It is a simple and easy-to-read language for both developers and non-developers, making it an ideal tool for communication between development and business teams.

## What is Gherkin used for?

Gherkin is mainly used in the context of behavior-driven development (BDD), a software development methodology that focuses on software behavior from the user's perspective.

## How does Gherkin work?

Normalmente se utiliza Gherkin mediante herramientas de terceros, pero nosotros vamos a hacer uso de gherkin mediante la documentaci√≥n de los test. Hay una serie de palabras clave para hacer uso de gherkin:

- Feature: Describes a software funcionality.
- Scenario: Describes a specific test case for a feature.
- GIVEN: Describe the initial context of the scenario.
- WHEN: Describes the action that is performed in the scenario.
- THEN: Describes the expected result of the action. 

## Example

## Benefits of using Gherkin:
- **Improves communication**: Gherkin facilitates communication between development and business teams, as both can understand the tests clearly and easily.
- **Increases software quality**: Gherkin testing helps detect bugs in the early stages of development, which reduces the time and cost to fix them.
- **Encourages iterative development**: Gherkin tests can be written and executed quickly and easily, which facilitates iterative software development.
