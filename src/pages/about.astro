			I'm a web developer and <strong>software engineer</strong> passionate about creating <strong
				>innovative</strong
			>
			and <strong>robust</strong> solutions. For the past few years, I've been working as a fullstack
			developer, although I've always found my true passion in the <strong>backend</strong>.
		</p>

		<p class="mb-4 text-base">
			As a developer, my main focus is to make sure that every <strong>line of code</strong> I write
			meets the <strong>highest quality standards</strong>. For me, this means code that is
			<strong>testable</strong>, <strong>maintainable</strong> and <strong>scalable</strong>.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4 text-base">
			During my career, I have spent time and effort studying and applying concepts such as
			<strong>hexagonal architecture</strong> and <strong>Domain-Driven Design (DDD)</strong>. These
			methodologies have not only contributed to strengthening my software development skills, but
			have also improved my ability to <strong>communicate</strong> and
			<strong>collaborate</strong> effectively with multidisciplinary teams.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4 text-base">
			I'm excited to share with you some of the projects I've worked on and the <strong
				>technologies</strong
			> I've mastered along the way.
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4 text-base">
			Thanks for visiting my portfolio and I hope to have the <strong
				>opportunity to collaborate together soon!</strong
